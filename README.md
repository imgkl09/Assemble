# Assemble 
Our idea is to create a platform where people are recognized by the projects 
that they build and the skills that they possess. And to enable brilliant like-minded 
people to collaborate easily. People or groups can find the necessary skill they 
require with our platform. We allow talented people to be viewed by other users 
by posting about their projects and their skills and help them find collaborators 
for their side-projects and works.

ASSEMBLE is the name of the platform we created. It allows users to 
provide their personal and their skillset information to create their account 
which can be used by other users to search for the skillset they are looking 
for. We provide provisions for users to create their own team which can be 
viewed by others and interested users can send request to join which will be 
reviewed by the team creator based on their user profile.
